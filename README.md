# Wedding Website
A beautiful, feature rich, device friendly wedding website.  
_See [wedding.rampatra.com](http://wedding.rampatra.com/) for a demo. Use invite code `271117` to RSVP._

# Highlights
1. Slick and fully __responsive__ design.
2. __RSVP feature__ which directly uploads data to a Google sheet.
3. __Receive email alerts__ when someone RSVPs.
4. __Add to Calendar__ feature which supports four different calendars.
5. __Book Uber__ button lets guests book a cab to the venue with just a single tap.
6. A nice __Youtube video__ showing your venue.
7. __Google Map__ showing your venue's location.
8. Start and run the website __completely free__. No hosting, backend server, or database required as you can use
   [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host and Google sheets (with the help of Google scripts) to store RSVP
   data.
